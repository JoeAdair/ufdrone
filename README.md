Allow users to report and view drone activity

Friday December 13th and there are "drones" everywhere with no information about them.  This app is meant to be a simple way to allow users to log drone sightings.  I'm hoping maybbe this could be one central repository with drone sighting information.  At the very least it could be a fun little project to knock out on a Friday night....
